Stop running `npm version patch` manually to release a new version of your NPM package. Let this Action automate for you. Trigger it on GitHub or schedule a weekly or monthly release.

## Examples

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 12 * * 0' # every sunday noon

jobs:
  release:
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - id: release
        uses: CatChen/node-package-release-action@v2
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # optional
          directory: './' #optional
          release-type: prerelease # optional
          prerelease: false # optional
          update-shorthand-release: false
          skip-if-no-diff: false
          dry-run: false # optional

      - env:
          TAG: ${{ steps.release.outputs.tag }}
          SKIPPED: ${{ steps.release.outputs.skipped }}
        run: |
          if [[ "$SKIPPED"='true' ]]
          then
            echo 'Release is skipped.'
          else
            echo "Release $TAG successfully."
          fi
```

## Options

### `github-token`

The default value is `${{ github.token }}`, which is the GitHub token generated for this workflow. You can [create a different token with a different set of permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) and use it here as well.

### `directory`

The default value is `"./"`. It's where the `package.json` locates.

### `release-type`

Which part of the [semver](https://semver.org/) should be increased for the next release. Valid inputs are `major`, `premajor`, `minor`, `preminor`, `patch`, `prepatch` and `prerelease`. The list of valid inputs is from [`semver.inc`](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#functions), which is used by the `npm version` command. The default value is `prerelease`. This is independent from the `prerelease` input.

### `prerelease`

This controls whether the GitHub Release should be marked as a prerelease. The default value is `false`. This is independent from the `release-type` input.

### `update-shorthand-release`

[GitHub Action documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions#using-tags-for-release-management) recommends updating shorthand releases like `v1` and `v1.2` when releasing the latest `v1.2.*`. Set this to `true` when using this Action to release other Actions. The default value is `false`.

### `skip-if-no-diff`

This controls whether this action should do nothing if there's no changes since last release of the same release type. If we release a minor upgrade to `1.2.3` or `1.2.4-0` it should be `1.2.4`. If `1.2.4` and `1.2.3` are the same and if `skip-if-no-diff` is set to `true`, `1.2.4` won't be created. `1.2.4-*` won't be used in the comparison. The default value is `false`.

### `diff-targets`

This controls the diff targets used with `skip-if-no-diff`. The default value is `"."`. For example, it could be `"{package.json,lib/**/*}"` for a typical TypeScript project with compiled files in the `lib` directory. Use glob pattern to match multiple directories if necessary, for example `"{src,lib}"` instead of `"src lib"` or `"{src, lib}"` to match both the `src` directory and the `lib` directory.

### `dry-run`

This controls whether this is a dry run. The default value is `false`. It's used for debugging only.

## FAQ

### How do all the `release-type` options work?

Let's start with the easy ones. `major`, `minor` and `patch` increase their corresponding part and reset the parts behind them to zero.

- `2.3.4` + `major` => `3.0.0`
- `2.3.4` + `minor` => `2.4.0`
- `2.3.4` + `patch` => `2.3.5`

`prerelease` is an interesting one. It increases the prerelease part if it exists. Otherwise, it increases the patch part and append a prerelease zero suffix.

- `2.3.4-0` + `prerelease` => `2.3.4-1`
- `2.3.4` + `prerelease` => `2.3.5-0`

`premajor`, `preminor` and `prepatch` are like `major`, `minor` and `patch` with a prerelease zero suffix, regardless of whether the original version has a prerelease part.

- `2.3.4` + `premajor` => `3.0.0-0`
- `2.3.4-5` + `premajor` => `3.0.0-0`
- `2.3.4` + `preminor` => `2.4.0-0`
- `2.3.4-5` + `preminor` => `2.4.0-0`
- `2.3.4` + `prepatch` => `2.3.5-0`
- `2.3.4-5` + `prepatch` => `2.3.5-0`

### Can I create a Workflow to manually release with any release type I want at the time?

Yes! You can provide inputs in the Action web interface before manually triggering a Workflow. [GitHub Action documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#providing-inputs) describes how to do this. Below is an example.

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      release-type:
        description: 'Release Type'
        required: true
        default: 'patch'
        type: choice
        options:
          - major
          - minor
          - patch
          - premajor
          - preminor
          - prepatch
          - prerelease
      prerelease:
        description: 'Prerelease'
        required: true
        default: false
        type: boolean
      dry-run:
        description: 'Dry run'
        required: true
        default: false
        type: boolean

  release:
    name: Release
    concurrency: release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: 'main'

      - uses: CatChen/node-package-release-action@v2
        with:
          release-type: ${{ inputs.release-type || 'patch' }}
          prerelease: ${{ inputs.prerelease || false }}
          dry-run: ${{ inputs.dry-run || false }}
```

### How do I know if `skip-if-no-diff` took effect?

Use an output called `skipped`. See the first code example as a reference.

### What does "last release of the same release type" mean for `skip-if-no-diff`?

Let's say these are the releases returned from `git tag`:

- `v1.0.0`
- `v1.1.0`
- `v1.2.0`
- `v1.2.1`
- `v1.2.2`
- `v1.2.3`
- `v1.2.4-0`
- `v1.2.4-1`

We are going to make a patch release. The release version will be `1.2.4`. `1.2.4`'s last release of the same type (patch) is `1.2.3`.

Before `1.2.3` there is `1.2.2`, but `1.2.2` + `patch` doesn't equal to `1.2.4`. `1.2.2` isn't the last release of the same release type.

After `1.2.3` there is `1.2.4-0` and `1.2.4-0` + `patch` equals to `1.2.4`. However, we should pick `1.2.3`. If there's any diff since `1.2.3` we should make the `1.2.4` release. When we say "release `1.2.4` as a patch if this patch contains any change", we mean changes since `1.2.3`. Even if there's no change since `1.2.4-0` we should still make the release. That's because `1.2.4-0` as a prepatch release may already contains all the changes we want so there's no change since `1.2.4-0`.
